Today, I'm trying to move all my personal stuff to a new blog, which created via HEXO, host on github.
Basically, I want to keep my daily things to a fix place, as people says, learn from the past.
Then I meet a kid, a young programer, all of sudden, I feel I have a lot things to learn, there is a lot space to move on.

Here just do a mark, warn myself.
